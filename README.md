# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, from the Hub 
ðŸ‘€ We are the Financial Innovation Hub of South Africa! We are based out of the University of Cape Town and are sponsored by the Algorand Foundation. We are a team of the brighest minds tackling innovation in the fintech industry. 
<ul>
We are broken into 3 parts:
  
- First, rigorous academic research on blockchain, central bank digital currencies, privacy, cyber security, and digital inclusion making meaningful contributions on the forefront of current knowledge.
  
- Second, an innovation lab for student-led startups with a uniquely African focus helping to translate the latest academic research into non-commercial (open source) projects and commercially viable startups contributing to the overall Algorand ecosystem.
  
- And third, the lab will be a platform for thought leadership, and in particular for ongoing engagement with policy and law makers, as well as with the financial services industry.
